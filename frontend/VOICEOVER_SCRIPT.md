### **🎯 Introduction (30 seconds)**
"Welcome to the future of digital ownership verification. I'm [Your Name], and today I'm excited to show you Memento - a revolutionary platform that's solving one of the biggest challenges in our digital age: how do we prove authenticity and ownership in a world where anything can be copied, altered, or misattributed?"

### **🔍 The Problem (45 seconds)**
"Think about it: every day, millions of digital files are created - research papers, software code, legal documents, creative works, photographs. But how do we prove:
- When was it really created?
- Who is the true creator?
- Has it been modified since creation?
- Can we establish an unbreakable timestamp?

Current solutions are fragile. Screenshots can be photoshopped. File timestamps can be altered. Digital signatures can be forged. We need something better."

### **💡 The Solution (60 seconds)**
"This is where Memento changes everything. Using the power of blockchain technology and cryptographic hashing, Memento creates immutable, verifiable proofs of existence and ownership."

"Let me walk you through exactly how it works, with a live demonstration of each step."

### **🎬 Live Demo Narration**

#### **📋 Step 1: Upload & Hashing**
[As you upload a file in the demo]
"Watch as I upload this important research paper. Memento immediately calculates its SHA-256 hash - a unique digital fingerprint that mathematically represents this exact file."

[Show the hash appearing on screen]
"This hash is cryptographically secure. Even if one pixel changes, the entire hash changes. It's like a digital DNA for this file."

#### **🔗 Step 2: Wallet Connection** 
[As you prepare to connect wallet]
"Now I need to establish my identity on the blockchain to prove I'm the real creator. I'll connect my MetaMask wallet..."

[Show MetaMask connection popup]
"This wallet connection establishes my unique blockchain address. It's my digital identity that can't be forged."

#### **✍️ Step 3: Authorship Signature**
[As you prepare to sign]
"This is the magic moment - I'm about to create a cryptographic signature that proves I created this file at this exact time. This signature is mathematically impossible to forge."

[Show signature popup and confirmation]
"With this signature, I've established authorship that's permanently tied to my identity and timestamped on the blockchain."

#### **⛓ Step 4: Blockchain Transaction**
[As transaction processes]
"And now... the permanent record. I'm sending this proof to the Ethereum blockchain where it will be stored forever."

[Show transaction pending, then confirmed]
"Once this transaction is mined, this proof exists permanently. No one can alter it, no one can dispute it."

#### **🏆 Step 5: Certificate Generation**
[As certificate appears]
"And here it is - a beautiful certificate of authenticity that anyone can verify. It shows my wallet address as creator, the exact timestamp, and the file's unique hash."

[Show certificate with all details]
"This certificate is shareable, verifiable, and permanent. It's digital notarization for the 21st century."

#### **📱 Step 6: Sharing & Verification**
[As you demonstrate sharing]
"Watch how easily this can be shared and verified. The QR code provides instant verification, the Etherscan link shows public blockchain records, and the share functionality lets me send this to anyone."

[Demonstrate mobile sharing and desktop copying]
"Complete transparency and verifiability in seconds."
