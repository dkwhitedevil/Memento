# Memento - Complete Walkthrough Script & Demo Plan

## 🎯 **Demo Script (2-3 minutes)**

### **🎬 Opening Hook**
"Welcome to Memento - the future of digital ownership verification! Today I'll show you how blockchain technology is revolutionizing how we prove authenticity in the digital age."

"Imagine you've just created a groundbreaking research paper, written a novel, or designed a unique piece of software. How do you prove it's yours? How do you establish ownership before anyone else can claim it? That's where Memento comes in."

### **📋 Step-by-Step Demo Flow**

#### **1. The Problem (30 seconds)**
"In today's digital world, proving authorship and timestamping creative work is a massive challenge. Screenshots can be photoshopped, timestamps can be altered, and digital files can be duplicated without detection."

#### **2. The Solution (60 seconds)**
"Memento uses cryptographic hashing and blockchain technology to create immutable, verifiable proofs of existence. Let me walk you through exactly how it works."

#### **3. Live Demo - Upload & Hash (90 seconds)**
"Watch as I upload this important document (could be a contract, research paper, or creative work)."
*[Upload a sample file - show the file selection interface]*
"Look at this - it's a SHA-256 hash. This is like a digital fingerprint - completely unique to this file."

#### **4. Live Demo - MetaMask Connection (45 seconds)**
"Now I need to connect my wallet to prove I'm the real creator."
*[Connect wallet - show MetaMask popup]*
"This wallet connection establishes my identity on the blockchain - it's my digital signature."

#### **5. Live Demo - Authorship Signature (60 seconds)**
"This is the magic moment - I'm going to cryptographically sign a message proving I created this file."
*[Sign message with MetaMask - show the signature popup]*
"This signature is mathematically impossible to forge, proving I'm the creator at this specific time."

#### **6. Live Demo - Blockchain Transaction (90 seconds)**
"And now... the permanent record. I'm sending this proof to the Ethereum blockchain."
*[Create proof - show transaction pending]*
"Once this transaction is mined, this proof exists FOREVER. No one can alter it, no one can dispute it."

#### **7. Live Demo - Etherscan Verification (45 seconds)**
"Look! The transaction is now visible on Etherscan - the public blockchain explorer."
*[Open Etherscan in new tab]*
"Anyone in the world can verify this transaction. This is complete transparency."

#### **8. Live Demo - Certificate Generation (60 seconds)**
"And here it is - your beautiful certificate of authenticity!"
*[Redirect to certificate page]*
"This certificate shows the creator, timestamp, file hash, and verification status. It's shareable, verifiable, and permanent."

#### **9. Live Demo - Certificate Features (90 seconds)**
"Let me show you the amazing features of this certificate:"
*[Show certificate page with all features]*
"QR code for instant verification, Etherscan links, copy functionality, and professional design."

#### **10. Live Demo - Sharing & Verification (45 seconds)**
"Watch how easily this can be shared and verified!"
*[Share certificate - show native share dialog]*
"Anyone with the link can verify this proof on the blockchain in seconds."

### **🏆 The Impact (30 seconds)**

"This isn't just about file verification - it's about:
- ✅ Protecting intellectual property
- ✅ Establishing digital ownership
- ✅ Creating permanent timestamps
- ✅ Enabling fair attribution
- ✅ Building trust in digital content

Memento is solving real problems that creators face every day."

### **🚀 Call to Action (30 seconds)**

"Now imagine this technology applied to:
- Academic research validation
- Software development timestamping
- Legal contract verification
- Journalism source protection
- Creative portfolio authentication

The possibilities are endless!"

### **🎊 Closing (15 seconds)**

"Memento: Where blockchain meets real-world creativity. Immutable proofs for the digital age."
